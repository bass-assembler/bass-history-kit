Source material from tukuyomi
=============================

The files in subdirectories below this one
came from the tukuyomi SNES emulation archive,
which was once at http://black-ship.net/~tukuyomi/snesemu/
but is now on the Internet Archive:
https://archive.org/details/tukuyomi-snes-archive

For example, the file [misc/bass_changelog.txt](misc/bass_changelog.txt)
was originally http://black-ship.net/~tukuyomi/snesemu/misc/bass_changelog.txt

Files directly inside this directory
(this README, `.gitignore`, `*.do`, etc.)
are not from the tukuyomi archive.
